# cache-simulator
The simulator supports different configurations of associativity, cache size, and block size. These 3 are the major tuning parameters in cache design. Each policy is simulated for a full range of these 3 parameters to see how the tuning affects the cache performance. The simulator is implemented in Python, and the results are shown below.
